    I’m actively looking for internship opportunities in the field of Web Development and Software Engineering. I’m eager to work with a team, grow my technical skills, and gain hands-on experience in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
      I work with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am building projects to strengthen my backend skills as well. 
      I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and contributing to meaningful real-world projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open to internships — hybrid or remote.
